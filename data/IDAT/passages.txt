What characteristics did engineers have in the second half of the 20th century?
Engineers in the second half of the 20th century became more science-based, although 'design' content increased slowly.
What skills will engineers need in the 21st century?
Engineers in the 21st century will need the ability to identify new needs, find new solutions, and make things happen.
What is an entrepreneurial engineer?
An entrepreneurial engineer is an engineer with an entrepreneurial spirit and managerial skills to identify needs, come up with new solutions, and see them through.
What basic skills do engineers need to master?
Engineers need the ability to find any information quickly, evaluate, and use that information.
How do modern engineering tools assist engineers?
Modern engineering tools free engineers from routine calculations and allow them to analyze tasks that would have been impossible a decade or two ago.
Why is collaboration and teamwork required in modern engineering design?
The complexity of modern engineering designs and the speed at which they must be developed call for collaboration and teamwork.
How do engineers realize their imagination?
Engineers realize their imagination through an entrepreneurial spirit and managerial skills.
What role does AI play in the field of engineering?
The role of AI in engineering is not explicitly stated in the document, but it is speculated to involve automation, data analysis, and decision support.
